# 🚀 Phase 1: Integration & Testing - Progress Tracker

**Started:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress  
**Current Task:** Task 1.1 - Start and Verify Backend API

## 📊 Task Status

### Task 1.1: Start and Verify Backend API 🟡
**Status:** In Progress - API Container Issues  
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
**Started:** October 31, 2025

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Docker Desktop is running
- ✅ PostgreSQL container healthy (port 5433)
- ✅ Redis container healthy (port 6380)
- ✅ Database migrations applied (7 tables exist)
- ✅ Database seeded (16 users found)
- ⚠️ API container has dependency issues (nest CLI not found)
- ⚠️ API not responding on port 4000

**Current Issue:**
- API container failing: "npm error could not determine executable to run"
- This suggests @nestjs/cli might not be installed in container
- Need to rebuild API container or run API locally

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Docker Desktop running
2. ✅ Infrastructure services started
3. ✅ Database ready (migrated and seeded)
4. 🔄 Starting API locally (Docker container has dependency issues)
5. ⏳ Verify API health endpoint
4. Verify services are healthy

**Alternative Options:**
1. **Option A:** Start Docker Desktop (Recommended)
   - Open Docker Desktop application
   - Wait for it to fully initialize
   - Continue with Phase 1

2. **Option B:** Local Development (Without Docker)
   - Install PostgreSQL locally (port 5432)
   - Install Redis locally (port 6379)
   - Configure local connection strings
   - Run API directly with `pnpm dev`

3. **Option C:** Test with Mock API (Frontend Only)
   - Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_AUTH=true`
   - Test frontend flows without backend
   - Note: Limited testing capability
