## 🎨 Animation Sequence

| Step | Time | What Happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| **0** | 0-1s | Castle appears with moon and stars |
| **1** | 1-3s | Three armies assemble around castle |
| **2** | 3-8s | Battle begins - projectiles fly |
| **3** | 8-11s | Intense combat - double projectile rate |
| **4** | 11-13s | Victor emerges - defeated armies fade |
| **5** | 13-15s | Green flag raises on castle |
| **6** | 15-16.5s | "VulHub LeaderBoard" title reveals |
| **7** | 16.5s+ | Auth form fades in |

## 🎨 Color Scheme

| Force | Color | Hex |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Red Army | <span style="color: #ef4444">■</span> Red | `#ef4444` |
| Blue Army | <span style="color: #3b82f6">■</span> Blue | `#3b82f6` |
| Orange Army | <span style="color: #f59e0b">■</span> Orange | `#f59e0b` |
| Victor (CSUSB) | <span style="color: #00ff00">■</span> Matrix Green | `#00ff00` |

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Particle System
- **Dynamic generation**: Projectiles spawn every 150-300ms during battle
- **Physics simulation**: Smooth interpolation from start to target
- **Lifecycle management**: Auto-cleanup when animations complete
- **Visual feedback**: Explosions on impact with scaling glow effects

### State Management
```typescript
const [step, setStep] = useState(0);           // Animation step (0-6)
const [projectiles, setProjectiles] = useState<Projectile[]>([]);
const [explosions, setExplosions] = useState<Explosion[]>([]);
const [castleHealth, setCastleHealth] = useState(100);
const [flagRaising, setFlagRaising] = useState(false);
const [flagHeight, setFlagHeight] = useState(0);
```

### Performance
- ✅ **No memory leaks**: All intervals/timeouts cleaned up
- ✅ **Efficient rendering**: Only renders when `phase === 'intro'`
- ✅ **GPU acceleration**: Uses transforms and fixed positioning
- ✅ **Smart cleanup**: Old projectiles/explosions auto-removed

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

```
User visits /auth
    ↓
Castle Siege Animation Plays (16.5s)
    ↓
onComplete callback fires
    ↓
animationPhase = 'idle'
showForm = true
    ↓
Auth form fades in with entrance animation
    ↓
User can sign in/sign up
```

## 🚀 Integration Points

### Auth Page Integration
```typescript
<CastleSiegeAnimation 
  phase={animationPhase} 
  onComplete={handleAnimationComplete}
/>

{showForm && (
  <div className="animate-auth-form-entrance">
    {/* Auth form content */}
  </div>
)}
```

### Animation Control
```typescript
const handleAnimationComplete = () => {
  setAnimationPhase('idle');
  setShowForm(true);
};
```
