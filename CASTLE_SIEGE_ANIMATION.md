# Castle Siege Animation - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The **Castle Siege Animation** is an epic, cinematic intro sequence for the VulHub LeaderBoard authentication page. It depicts a medieval castle under siege from multiple colored forces, culminating in a victorious flag raising that reveals the VulHub LeaderBoard title.

## Animation Story

### Act 1: The Castle (0-1s)
- A majestic castle appears on screen under a starlit sky with a glowing moon
- The castle features:
  - Central fortress with multiple windows
  - Two flanking towers with red roofs
  - Detailed gate and architecture
  - Health bar (appears in battle)

### Act 2: The Armies Assemble (1-3s)
- Three colored armies appear from different directions:
  - **Red Force (Left)**: 15 units attacking from the left flank
  - **Blue Force (Right)**: 15 units attacking from the right flank
  - **Orange Force (Bottom)**: 10 units attacking from the base
- Units are represented as glowing, pulsing squares

### Act 3: The Battle Begins (3-8s)
- Projectiles fly from all armies toward the castle
- Each projectile:
  - Matches its army's color
  - Follows a curved trajectory
  - Creates an explosion on impact
- Explosions:
  - Radiate outward with color-matching glow
  - Scale up and fade out smoothly
  - Reduce castle health with each hit

### Act 4: Intense Combat (8-11s)
- Battle intensity increases dramatically
- Projectile frequency doubles (150ms intervals)
- Castle health depletes to critical levels
- Visual effects intensify

### Act 5: Victor Emerges (11-13s)
- Battle slows as a winner becomes clear
- Defeated armies fade to 20% opacity and shrink
- Surviving units turn green (victor color)
- "VICTORY" text appears and bounces
- Castle health stabilizes

### Act 6: Flag Raising (13-15s)
- A green flag slowly raises on the castle's central pole
- Flag design:
  - Gradient green (Matrix theme)
  - "CSUSB" text appears on flag
  - Glowing effect
  - Dramatic unfurling animation

### Act 7: Title Reveal (15-16.5s)
- **"VulHub LeaderBoard"** title appears in massive green text
- Dramatic pulse and glow effects
- **"by CSUSB"** subtitle fades in below
- Three pills appear beneath:
  - "Compete"
  - "Learn"
  - "Conquer"

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```
CastleSiegeAnimation
├── Background Layer (Stars, Moon, Ground)
├── Castle Structure (Main body, Towers, Gate)
├── Army Units (3 forces, multiple units each)
├── Projectiles System (Dynamic generation)
├── Explosions System (Impact effects)
├── Health Bar (Castle integrity)
├── Victory Declaration
└── Title Reveal
```

### Key Technologies

- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` for state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and animations
- **Custom CSS Animations**: `bounce-subtle`, `pulse-slow`
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with `AnimationPhase`

### State Management

```typescript
interface State {
  step: number;                    // Current animation step (0-6)
  projectiles: Projectile[];       // Active projectiles
  explosions: Explosion[];         // Active explosions
  castleHealth: number;            // Castle HP (0-100)
  flagRaising: boolean;            // Flag animation trigger
  flagHeight: number;              // Flag raise progress (0-100)
}
```

### Projectile System

Each projectile has:
- **Start position**: Based on army location
- **Target position**: Random point on castle
- **Color**: Matches army color
- **Progress**: 0-1 animation progress

Projectiles are animated at 50ms intervals, reaching their target in ~1 second.

### Explosion System

Explosions:
- Spawn at projectile impact point
- Scale from 0 to 1 over 500ms
- Fade out as they scale up
- Auto-remove after animation

### Timing Sequence

| Step | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | 1000ms | Castle appears |
| 1 | 2000ms | Armies assemble |
| 2 | 5000ms | Battle begins |
| 3 | 3000ms | Intense battle |
| 4 | 2000ms | Victor emerges |
| 5 | 2000ms | Flag raising |
| 6 | 1500ms | Title reveal |
| **Total** | **16.5s** | **Complete sequence** |

## Integration with Auth System

### Flow

1. User navigates to `/auth`
2. Castle Siege animation plays automatically
3. `onComplete` callback fires after 16.5s
4. Auth form fades in with `animate-auth-form-entrance`
5. User can now sign in/sign up

### Animation Control

```typescript
const [animationPhase, setAnimationPhase] = useState<AnimationPhase>('intro');
const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);

const handleAnimationComplete = () => {
  setAnimationPhase('idle');
  setShowForm(true);
};
```

### Props

```typescript
interface CastleSiegeAnimationProps {
  phase: AnimationPhase;           // Current animation phase
  onComplete?: () => void;         // Callback when animation finishes
}
```

## Visual Effects

### Color Palette

| Element | Color | RGB |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Red Force | `#ef4444` | 239, 68, 68 |
| Blue Force | `#3b82f6` | 59, 130, 246 |
| Orange Force | `#f59e0b` | 245, 158, 11 |
| Victor (Green) | `#00ff00` | 0, 255, 0 |
| Castle | `#374151` - `#1f2937` | Gray gradient |
| Sky | `#172554` - `#000000` | Blue to black |

### Animations Used

- `animate-pulse`: Army units, stars
- `animate-fade-in`: Title, subtitle, pills
- `animate-bounce-subtle`: Victory text
- `animate-pulse-slow`: Main title
- `animate-auth-form-entrance`: Auth form (after animation)

### Shadow & Glow Effects

- Moon: `0 0 60px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`
- Castle windows: `0 0 10px rgba(255, 200, 0, 0.8)`
- Projectiles: `0 0 8px [army color]`
- Explosions: `0 0 [40*scale]px [army color]`
- Flag: `0 0 20px #00ff00`
- Title: `0 0 30px #00ff00, 0 0 60px #00ff00`

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Projectile Pooling**: Old projectiles removed when progress >= 1
2. **Explosion Cleanup**: Auto-removed after 500ms
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Only render when `phase === 'intro'`
4. **Effect Cleanup**: All intervals/timeouts properly cleared
5. **Fixed Positioning**: Uses `position: absolute` for GPU acceleration

### Resource Usage

- **Max Projectiles**: ~20-30 concurrent (at peak)
- **Max Explosions**: ~10-15 concurrent (at peak)
- **Static Elements**: 100 stars, 1 moon, 1 castle, ~40 army units
- **Total DOM Nodes**: ~200-250 (peak), ~0 (after completion)

## Accessibility

### Motion Sensitivity

The animation respects user preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Consider adding simplified animation */
}
```

### Skip Option

Users can press a key (future enhancement) to skip to the auth form immediately:

```typescript
const handleSkip = () => {
  setAnimationPhase('idle');
  setShowForm(true);
};
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/components/auth/CastleSiegeAnimation.tsx` (378 lines)
