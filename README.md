### 🗣️ Community Forum (Terminal-Style)

The **Community Forum** presents discussions in a retro terminal interface, creating an immersive, hacker-aesthetic experience.

**How It Works:**
1. Users enter the "Community Terminal"
2. Type commands to search vulnerabilities or browse categories
3. Select a vulnerability to view or create discussion threads
4. Post comments, get upvotes, and earn reputation points

**Command System:**
```bash
$ help                      # Show available commands
$ list categories          # View all vulnerability categories
$ search <query>           # Search for vulnerabilities or categories
$ <category name>          # View vulnerabilities in a category
$ <vulnerability name>     # Open discussion thread
$ back                     # Return to welcome screen
$ clear                    # Clear terminal history
```

**Engagement Features:**
- **Thread Creation**: Discuss any vulnerability with context
- **Upvoting & Liking**: Comments and posts can be voted on
- **Reputation System**: Likes (+1 point), upvotes (+2 points)
- **Cross-Linking**: Tag vulnerabilities directly (e.g., `#langflow/CVE-2025-3248`)
- **Category Filtering**: Browse by technology/platform

**Visual Design:**
- Dramatic welcome overlay with typing animation asking "What knowledge do you seek?"
- Matrix-green terminal aesthetic with glowing text
- Smooth transitions between views
- Real-time updates to community content

## Getting Started

> **🚀 New to the project?** Start with [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) for a 10-minute setup guide!

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **pnpm** 8.0 or higher (recommended over npm for monorepo support)
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **PostgreSQL** 14+ (for local database) OR Docker Desktop (for containerized setup)
- **Redis** (optional, for caching) or use in-memory fallback

### Installation

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Testing)

> **💡 For the fastest setup, see [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)**

**Step 1: Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/des-work/VulHub-LeaderBoard-Web.git
   cd VulHub-LeaderBoard-Web
   ```

**Step 2: Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

**Step 3: Set up environment variables**

**Frontend:** Copy the example file and customize:
```bash
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
```

The example file includes:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4010/api/v1
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Backend:** Copy the example file and customize:
```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

Then update the database connection in `apps/api/.env`:
- **With Docker Compose** (recommended): Already configured in example
- **With Local PostgreSQL**: Update `DATABASE_URL` to your local database
- **Other required vars**: `JWT_SECRET`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `TENANT_ID`

See [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) for detailed environment setup.

**Step 4: Set up the database**

If using Docker Compose:
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis
pnpm dev:stack

# Wait 10 seconds for services to start
```

Then set up the database schema:
```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma db push       # Create database tables
pnpm db:seed              # Load test data (users, challenges, etc.)
cd ../..
```

**Step 5: Run development servers**
```bash
# From project root, this starts both frontend and API
pnpm dev
```

**Access Points:**
- Frontend: **http://localhost:3010**
- API: **http://localhost:4010/api/v1**
- Health Check: **http://localhost:4010/api/v1/health**

**Test Login Credentials** (after seeding):
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

#### Option 2: Docker Setup

For a fully containerized development environment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Services will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3010
- API: http://localhost:4010/api/v1
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5433
- Redis: localhost:6380

pnpm install
```

#### Issue: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"
**Solution**: Clear cache and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache apps/web/.next
pnpm install
```

#### Issue: "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env`:
```bash
cat apps/api/.env | grep DATABASE_URL
```
Also check that PostgreSQL is running.

#### Issue: "API not reachable from frontend"
**Solution**: Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:
```bash
cat apps/web/.env.local | grep NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```
Should be: `http://localhost:4010/api/v1`

#### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Check what's running on the port:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :3010
lsof -i :4010

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3010
netstat -ano | findstr :4010
```

Kill the process or use different ports in `.env` files.

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal running pnpm dev
   # Check for error messages
   ```

2. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Network tab for API errors
   - Console for JavaScript errors

3. **Check API logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for startup messages and errors
   ```

4. **Create an issue** on GitHub with:
   - Error message (full stack trace)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Operating system and Node.js version
   - Browser and DevTools information
