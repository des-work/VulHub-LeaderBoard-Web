### **Phase 2: UI System & Design (Weeks 3-4)**

#### **Week 3: Design System Foundation**
- [ ] **Design Tokens**
  - [ ] Color palette with semantic naming
  - [ ] Typography scale and font families
  - [ ] Spacing and sizing system
  - [ ] Animation and transition tokens

- [ ] **Component Primitives**
  - [ ] Button with variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
  - [ ] Input with validation states
  - [ ] Card with different styles
  - [ ] Badge and Tag components
  - [ ] Loading states and skeletons

#### **Week 4: Component Library & Storybook**
- [ ] **Pattern Components**
  - [ ] Form components with validation
  - [ ] Data table with sorting/filtering
  - [ ] Modal and Dialog components
  - [ ] Navigation components
  - [ ] Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)

- [ ] **Storybook Setup**
  - [ ] Component documentation
  - [ ] Interactive examples
  - [ ] Accessibility testing
  - [ ] Visual regression testing

### **Phase 2.5: "Cyber" Theme Activation & Rollout (Weeks 4-5)**

#### **Objective**: Activate and apply the existing "cyber" theme across the web application. This involves implementing the theme-switching mechanism, applying the "cyber" design tokens to all UI components, and adding special effects for an authentic retro-tech feel.

#### **Week 4: Theming Infrastructure & Core Component Styling**
- [ ] **Verify Design Tokens (`packages/ui`)**
  - **Colors**: Confirm the "cyber" theme's color palette (dark background, glowing green primary, accents) is defined in `color-system.ts` and correctly integrated with Tailwind CSS.
  - **Typography**: Ensure the monospaced font (e.g., 'JetBrains Mono' as mentioned in `PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`) is configured to be the primary font for the "cyber" theme.
  - **Effects**: Define `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` tokens in `design-tokens.ts` to create a "glow" effect for text and interactive elements, specific to the cyber theme.

- [ ] **Theming Infrastructure (`packages/ui` & `apps/web`)**
  - Implement the theme provider as planned in `UI_CUSTOMIZATION_STRATEGY.md`. A library like `next-themes` is ideal for this.
  - Use a `class`-based strategy. For example, adding a `theme-cyber` class to the `<body>` tag will activate the theme.
  - Configure Tailwind CSS to use the "cyber" theme styles when this class is present.

- [ ] **Apply "Cyber" Theme to Core Components (`packages/ui`)**
  - **Button**: Style the button component to use the cyber theme's primary green color, monospaced font, and a glow effect on hover/focus.
  - **Input**: Style inputs with a green border and a glowing focus state.
  - **Card**: Update the card component to use the dark background with a subtle green border or glow.
  - **Storybook**: Create new stories for each primitive component (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, etc.) to display its appearance under the "cyber" theme. This allows for isolated development and visual testing.

#### **Week 5: Pattern Components & Special Effects**
- [ ] **Apply "Cyber" Theme to Pattern Components (`packages/ui`)**
  - **Data Table**: Style the table with green text, monospaced font, and glowing headers. Rows should highlight with a green background on hover.
  - **Forms**: Ensure all form elements (selects, checkboxes) adopt the new aesthetic.
  - **Modals**: Style with a dark, semi-transparent backdrop and glowing green borders.

- [ ] **Implement "Hacker" Special Effects (`apps/web`)**
  - **Digital Rain Background**:
    - Create a new React component `<DigitalRain />`.
    - Use an HTML `<canvas>` element to render the classic falling green characters effect.
    - Ensure the component is memoized and optimized to prevent performance degradation.
    - Add this component to the main layout of the web app, making it visible on all pages when the theme is active.
  - **Scan Line Overlay**:
    - Create a CSS-only overlay with a repeating linear gradient to simulate a CRT monitor scan line effect. Apply this to the main application container.
  - **Text Glitch/Flicker Effect**:
    - Create a subtle CSS animation for text flicker or a "glitch" effect.
    - Apply this animation to key headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) or the main logo when the cyber theme is active.

- [ ] **Integrate and Test (`apps/web`)**
  - Add a theme-switcher toggle to the application's header or settings page.
  - Ensure the theme provider correctly applies the `theme-cyber` class to the root layout.
  - Perform a full visual review of the application with the new theme enabled, checking for consistency and readability.
  - Test on different browsers and screen sizes to ensure effects are rendered correctly.
